File manager written in MMBasic, designed for PicoCalc. 

HOW TO USE :

- up/down arrow to choose file
- right arrow to go to the next page
- enter to execute ( run file ) / change dir
- 'd' to view directories
- DEL button to remove files

DIRECTORY : 

- 'q' to go back ( exit from directories )

# There is a MENU with all of the avaible
  commands


You can change how many files will appear
on a single page

- EDIT fileExp.bas 
- FIND 'CONTROL CENTER' at start
- CHANGE 'fileLimit'

NOTE: 6 is recommended for PicoCalc
      Changing the number higher
      will break the menu, but won't
      break the code
